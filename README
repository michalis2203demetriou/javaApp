The application utilizes Spring Boot features for dependency injection, data access with JPA, and REST API development.

1. Model Class: Customer.java

Represents a customer record with attributes like customerRef, customerName, addressLine1, etc.
Contains getters and setters for each attribute to allow access and modification of data.

2. Service Class: CsvProcessor.java

Handles the processing of the CSV file.
Takes the file path as input.
Reads the CSV file line by line using a BufferedReader.
Parses each line and extracts customer data into a Customer object.
Delegates the saving of the Customer object to the CustomerService or sending as a JSOn to an external api.

3. Service Class: CustomerService.java

Provides methods for interacting with customer data.
Injects the CustomerRepository to perform database operations.
Defines a saveCustomer method that persists the provided Customer object to the database using the repository's save method.

4. Repository Interface: CustomerRepository.java

Extends the JpaRepository interface from Spring Data JPA.
Provides pre-defined methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Customer entities.
Defines a custom method findByCustomerRef to search for customers based on the customerRef attribute.

5. Controller Class: CustomerController.java

Provides REST API endpoints for interacting with customer data.
Maps to the base URL path /customers.
Defines a POST endpoint /upload that accepts a multipart file containing the CSV data.
Uses the injected CsvProcessor to process the uploaded CSV file.
Returns a success or error message based on the processing outcome.
Defines a GET endpoint /customers/{customerRef} that accepts a customer reference as a path variable.
Uses the injected CustomerService to retrieve customer information based on the reference.
Returns the retrieved customer data in JSON format if found, or a not-found response otherwise.

6. Main Class: DemoApplication.java

The primary entry point for the Spring Boot application.
Uses SpringApplication.run to launch the application.
Enables auto-configuration of Spring beans and components.
